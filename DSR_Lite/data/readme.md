Place the complete JSON file that we will ultimately input into the workflow here. This section uses \*\*DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp (non-thinking)\*\* for schema linking (n=3). You can replace the schema linking results from your other methods by following the corresponding table and column formats to improve DSR-SQL.



It is not recommended to directly use our schema linking results for the following reasons:

\- DSR-SQL does not conduct in-depth research on schema linking.

\- Corresponding logs are required when submitting to the official leaderboard.
