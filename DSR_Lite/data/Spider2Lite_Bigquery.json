The analysis should create a complete hour-by-hour breakdown for all zip codes by cross-joining distinct zip codes with distinct hours, including hours with zero trips. For each zip code and hour combination, calculate the total number of trips and the following time-based metrics: count of trips from 1 hour ago, 1 day (24 hours) ago, 7 days (168 hours) ago, and 14 days (336 hours) ago. Additionally, compute the 14-day and 21-day moving averages and standard deviations of trip counts, excluding the current hour. Only include trips with valid latitude and longitude coordinates. The final results should be sorted by the highest trip counts, showing only the top 5 groups with the most trips.",
